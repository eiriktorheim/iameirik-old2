Traditionally each brand has been working independently from each other, but at this time, the product and tech community collaborate much more on the underlying technology, tools and services. However, we do not have one place to get an overview of internal tools and services you as an internal development team can use today. A lack of standard and structure of documentation is another problem we want to solve.</p>

                        <p>To give the most relevant content to each users, we created a modular content system that serves different content depending on how much it knows about you. If a user is not logged in, it gives content based on the weekly lottery and sport schedule and what is most relevant at this hour. If you are logged content can be personalized for you.</p>
